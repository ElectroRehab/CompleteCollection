ASG Project 2 – Das Blinkenlights

QUESTIONS:
Consider what you would need to do to add a blue LED to pin 5.  
What parts do you need?
A:• 10K Ω pulldown resistor
  • Blue LED
  • Wires

How would you code it?  
A:• Contained in the zip file:
  	• Project2Code.txt
  	• Project2.ino
  
Give this a try.

What if you want your LEDs to blink differently?  
How would you write code to do the following?
•	Blink Red 3 times with 0.5 second delay
•	Blink Green 2 times with 0.25 second delay
•	Blink Red 2 times with 0.75 second day
•	Turn off for 2 seconds
•	Rinse and Repeat (normal loop method)
Does this get to be tedious?
Yes - I used for loop to help midigate this issue.
